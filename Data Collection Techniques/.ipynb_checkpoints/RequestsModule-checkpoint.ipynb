    "# Using `requests` Module for Data Collection\n",
    "\n",
    "Today we will see how to scrape websites and use requests module to download the raw html of a webpage. In this section we can safely use https://quotes.toscrape.com/ and https://books.toscrape.com/ for scraping demos\n",
    "## 1. What is `requests`?\n",
    "- `requests` is a Python library used to send HTTP requests easily.\n",
    "- It allows you to fetch the content of a webpage programmatically.\n",
    "- It is commonly used as the first step before parsing HTML with BeautifulSoup.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Installing `requests`\n",
    "To install `requests`, run:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install requests\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Sending a Basic GET Request\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import requests\n",
    "\n",
    "url = \"https://example.com\"\n",
    "response = requests.get(url)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Print the HTML content\n",
    "print(response.text)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key points**:\n",
    "- `url`: The website you want to fetch.\n",
    "- `response.text`: The HTML content of the page as a string.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Checking the Response Status\n",
    "\n",
    "Always check if the request was successful:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(response.status_code)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common Status Codes\n",
    "- `200`: OK (Success)\n",
    "- `404`: Not Found\n",
    "- `403`: Forbidden\n",
    "- `500`: Internal Server Error\n",
    "\n",
    "**Good practice**:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if response.status_code == 200:\n",
    "    print(\"Page fetched successfully!\")\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print(\"Failed to fetch the page.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Important Response Properties\n",
    "\n",
    "| Property | Description |\n",
    "|----------|-------------|\n",
    "| `response.text` | HTML content as Unicode text |\n",
    "| `response.content` | Raw bytes of the response |\n",
    "| `response.status_code` | HTTP status code |\n",
    "| `response.headers` | Metadata like content-type, server info |\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6. Adding Headers to Mimic a Browser\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes websites block automated requests. Adding a `User-Agent` header helps the request look like it is coming from a real browser.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "headers = {\n",
    "    \"User-Agent\": \"Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64)\"\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 7. Handling Connection Errors\n",
    "\n",
    "Wrap your request in a try-except block to handle errors gracefully:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    response = requests.get(url, timeout=5)\n",
    "    response.raise_for_status()  # Raises an HTTPError for bad responses\n",
    "    print(response.text)\n",
    "except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:\n",
    "    print(f\"An error occurred: {e}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 8. Best Practices for Fetching Pages\n",
    "- Always check the HTTP status code.\n",
    "- Use proper headers to mimic a browser.\n",
    "- Set a timeout to avoid hanging indefinitely.\n",
    "- Respect the website by not making too many rapid requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 9. Summary\n",
    "- `requests` makes it simple to fetch web pages using Python.\n",
    "- It is the starting point for most web scraping workflows.\n",
    "- Combining `requests` with BeautifulSoup allows for powerful data extraction.\n",
